	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Orders</h5>
		<p>
			All orders are subject to Envelopes.com's review and approval. We reserve the right to reject and not fulfill an order, or to withhold
			acceptance of an order until we take such steps as Envelopes.com deems necessary within our sole discretion to validate the billing,
			shipping and credit card information of the person or company placing the order.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most orders for plain envelopes ship the same or next business day. We do not guarantee same day shipping. Printed envelopes must go
			through prepress and production to be fulfilled, and have a production time associated with them.
		</p>
		<p>
			We process and ship orders Monday through Friday only. We are closed Saturday, Sunday and Holidays. If you place your order after 5:00PM
			ET on Friday, your order will not be processed until Monday.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your order has been processed for shipping, or has shipped, we cannot cancel your order. You can refuse the delivery, and your order
			will be subject to our <a href="http://support.envelopes.com/customer/portal/articles/828488-returns-">return policy.</a>

			that all charges, taxes and shipping/handling fees will automatically be charged to the credit card or paid by User with an approved
			payment method.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that no work will proceed on any print job in your order until full payment is received by Envelopes.com.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Payment Methods</h5>
		<p>
			All purchase requests must be submitted with an approved payment method unless otherwise expressly stated. Approved payment methods
			include any of the following:
		</p>
		<p>
			Pay by credit card. This is simple and safe. Most of our customers pay this way. Our secure server scrambles your payment data so that
			only our computers can decode it. Credit cards are the only method of payment accepted for all international orders.

		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Order Cancellatons</h5>
		<p>
			You may cancel your order for plain envelopes at any time prior to your order being shipped, unless it was deemed a special order, or
			custom "made to order" envelope.
		</p>
		<p>
			Printed envelope order cancellations will be subject to a $25.00 charge if you submitted files to our prepress department during or after
			your order was placed on the site. If you have approved your proof, but your order has not been printed or shipped, you may cancel your
			order, but you will be charged $40.00 for the time that was spent on your order in prepress and production.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Refund Policy</h5>
		<p>
			We accept returns of plain products if returned within 14 days of receiving the shipment. A refund for order amount, minus shipping and
			restocking fee (if applicable, see below) will be issued to the credit card used to place the order within 5 days of receiving and
			reviewing your return. Shipping charges are non-refundable for undelivered, unclaimed or refused packages, unless we made an error.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your return needs to be in re-sellable condition or a refund will not be processed. The carton the envelopes come in is part of the
			product, so please do not discard, deface, write on, or destroy the carton.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Exchanges</h5>
		<p>
			If you need a different size or color, you may exchange your order without a restocking fee if your replacement order is for the same
			quantity of product. First, please place your new order online, and include your new order number on the return slip of the original
			order. You are responsible for shipping the original item back to us, and you will receive a full refund for the product when it is
			returned and reviewed. You do not receive a refund for the original shipping charges, or the cost to ship back unwanted product.
		</p>

		<h5>Send Returns To</h5>
		<p>
			Envelopes.com<br />
			105 Maxess Rd.<br />
			Suite S215<br />
			Melville, NY 11747<br />
			Attn: Returns/Order# XXXXXX
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use whatever delivery service you choose (USPS, UPS, FedEx), but be sure to get a tracking number so you will be able to verify
			that we received the return. International customers should contact Customer Service to discuss the specific details of the issue before
			shipping any returns. This excludes Canada and US Territories.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Restocking Fee</h5>
		<p>
			There is a 25% restocking fee for all returns, which will be waived if a replacement order is placed. (see Exchanges above)
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Partial Returns</h5>
		<p>
			You may return part of an order, however you will be charged as if you only purchased what you are keeping. For example: If you purchased
			1,000 envelopes for $46.95, and returned 750 envelopes, we would charge you as if you only purchased 250 which cost $21.95, minus the
			restocking fee on the returned portion.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are unable to accept returns of printed envelopes unless we made a printing error.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you send back a return that is not eligible for a refund, it is your responsibility to pay an additional shipping charge if you would
			like the product back again.
		</p>
		<p>
			We accept returns of plain products if returned within 14 days of receiving the shipment. A refund for order amount, minus shipping and
			restocking fee (if applicable, see below) will be issued to the credit card used to place the order within 5 days of receiving and
			reviewing your return. Shipping charges are non-refundable for undelivered, unclaimed or refused packages, unless we made an error.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your return needs to be in re-sellable condition or a refund will not be processed. The carton the envelopes come in is part of the
			product, so please do not discard, deface, write on, or destroy the carton.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Sales Tax</h5>
		<p>
			Envelopes.com is required to collect sales tax on purchases shipped to New York, the state where we currently have business operations.
			For orders shipped to New York, tax is calculated based on the total order value and current tax rate of the county.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Tax-Exempt Individuals / Organizations/Businesses</h5>
		<p>
			If tax will be or was charged on your order and you would like to claim tax-exempt status, you can request an adjustment for the amount
			of sales tax charged by sending in documentation of your tax-exempt status. Before or after placing your order through the Site, please
			fax a copy of your tax-exempt certificate along with your order number to the attention of the Credit department at (631) 225-4896. Sales
			tax refunds will only be processed for orders placed during the current tax quarter. For requests outside of the current tax quarter,
			please contact the NY State Dept of taxation directly for information.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Paper Color Disclaimer</h5>
		<p>
			Envelopes.com will reproduce color from submitted print-ready files as closely as possible, but cannot exactly match color and density
			(as viewed in a 5000K light booth) because of limitations in the printing process. If you specify a Pantone color, we will match that
			color as closely as possible. Due to differences in paper color, brightness, and paper finish, Pantone colors will look different on all
			substrates. Inks are transparent and will be affected by the color of the paper.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Quantity Disclaimer</h5>
		<p>
			Due to variations in envelope manufacturing, you may find that cartons, boxes and packs may not contain the exact number of plain
			envelopes specified or ordered. It is common for the quantity to be + or - 2%. If you discover a shortage in excess of these percentages,
			please <a href="http://support.envelopes.com/customer/portal/emails/new">contact customer service.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Printed envelope orders are subject to quantity variations. Due to setup, waste, and quality control, the actual number of shipped
			envelopes may be up to 10% fewer than quantity ordered. Customers should account for this variation when ordering for purposes that need
			a specific quantity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to our printing process, we are not able to reprint quantities of less than 500 envelopes. If your order is missing less than 500
			envelopes, we may provide blank envelopes or refund the missing portion of the order.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Product Availability, Limitation on Quantities.</h5>
		<p>
			Envelopes.com does not guarantee the availability of any of our envelopes, and information regarding availability of our envelopes is
			subject to change without further notice. Availability may be limited at times, and some envelopes may not be available for immediate
			shipment. Envelopes.com reserves the right to make partial shipments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Envelopes.com also reserves the right without liability or prior notice to revise, discontinue or refuse to make available any of our
			envelopes, or to cancel any order in our sole discretion at any time. Envelopes.com shall not be responsible for any pictorial or
			typographical inaccuracies. We reserve the right to revoke an accepted order and to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions,
			including after an order has been submitted and accepted.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Artwork Files</h5>
		<p>
			Our prepress department checks most artwork files before printing, but you are still 100% responsible for the accuracy of your
			print-ready artwork files, and we encourage you to proofread all files carefully before submitting to Envelopes.com. As postal
			regulations are subject to change, you are also 100% responsible for complying with current mailing restrictions for your layouts.
			Check with your local Post Office. You certify that you have the right to use the image(s) in your artwork files.
		</p>
		<p>
			Under these Terms and Conditions, you agree that you will NOT upload any artwork files consisting of the following material: any material
			that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under applicable law; and any material that could infringe rights of privacy,
			publicity, copyrights or other intellectual property rights without the permission of the owner of these rights and the persons who are
			shown in the material if applicable.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h5>Proofs</h5>
		<p>
			We will produce a PDF proof for your review from your files or online design. It is your responsibility to review the proof in its
			entirety. The proof will show the basic size of the envelope, but seam lines, flap size, flap shape may be different on the actual
			envelope you are purchasing. If it is absolutely necessary to have the exact flap size, flap shape, or seams shown, you must notify
			Envelopes.com prior to printing your order, and we will advise you on our ability to provide what you want. Ink colors on your proof are
			a basic representation of the ink colors that will be printed. Actual ink color printed will be different than what is shown on a
			computer monitor. Ink colors will be affected by paper colors, but a monitor is not. All proofs are shown on a white envelope background.
			You will not see the paper color selected on your PDF proof. It will show the content to be printed only.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">

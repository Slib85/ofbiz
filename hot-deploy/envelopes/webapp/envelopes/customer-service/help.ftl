			Gate 7<br />
			EAST SYRACUSE, NY 13057<br />

			You may use any delivery service (USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc), but be sure to ship via a trackable method to ensure Envelopes.com receives
			your return.
		</p>
		<h6 class="blue bold">Refused Shipments:</h6>
		<p>
			If a shipment is refused, the carrier will return the package(s) to Envelopes.com. The customer is responsible for the cost of both the
			outbound shipping and the return shipping, and that amount will be deducted from any credit the customer is due. The restocking fee may
			also apply.
		</p>
		<h6 class="blue bold">Restocking Fee:</h6>
		<p>
			There is a <span class="bold">25% restocking fee</span> for all returns, which will be waived if a replacement order is placed.
		</p>
		<h6 class="blue bold">Partial Returns:</h6>
		<p>
			Partial returns are accepted and refunds will be processed for only the items sent back, less the restocking fee.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example: If you purchased 1,000 envelopes for $50.00, and returned 750 envelopes, you would be refunded $37.50 for the envelopes,
			less the restocking fee of $9.38, for a total refund of $28.12.<br />
			($50.00 - $37.50 - $9.38 = $28.12)
		</p>
		<h6 class="blue bold">Print Orders:</h6>
		<p>
			We do not accept returns of printed items, unless Envelopes.com is the responsible party for the printing error.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you send back a return that is not eligible for a refund, it is your responsibility to pay an additional shipping charge if you would
			like the product back again.
		</p>
		<h6 class="blue bold">Exchanges:</h6>
		<p>
			Exchanges for items of the same quantity or value are processed without a restocking fee.
		</p>
		<p>
			Place your new order online and include your new order number on the return slip of the original order.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note: Customers are responsible for return shipments of the original items.  Refunds do not include costs for the original
			shipment or costs incurred upon return shipment.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the replacement item is of higher value, you will be charged the difference of the replacement item over the original item value.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example: If you purchased 100 envelopes for $30.00 and exchanged the 100 envelopes for an item valued at $40.00, you would be charged
			the difference of $10.00.
		</p>
		<p>

		<h5>Product Samples</h5>
		<p class="bold blue">
			Samples are available to help you decide what style, size and color meets your needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">How do I order samples?</span><br />
			Click the link "Order a Sample" button located on the product page, under the orange Add to Cart button.  Sample orders can not be taken over the phone, live chat or email.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">Is there a shipping charge for samples?</span><br />
			No, the USPS First class mail postage is included in the $1.00 charged for the sample.
			In the event a Sample Order is deemed to exceed the US Postal Service First Class Mail guidelines you will be contacted by customer service regarding the fee for an alternate shipping method.
			Excluding Canada and the U.S. Territories, international customers are responsible for all shipping including duties, taxes, insurance and brokerage fees.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">How can I get my samples fast?</span><br />
			Free Shipping via USPS is pre-selected by default at checkout, but you may choose to upgrade the shipping service for the cost displayed next to each or you may use your own UPS or FedEx account by inputting your account number and preferred service level in the Shipping and Order Comments box at the checkout.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">Will all my samples come together?</span><br />
			If you order more than one sample, it is possible that the order will be sent from multiple locations and will arrive separately and possibly at different times. If you placed an order for product and samples, your samples will arrive separately via USPS First Class Mail.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">Can I track my samples?</span><br />
			Standard sample orders that are sent via USPS First Class Mail do not have a tracking number.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">Can I order samples over the phone?</span><br />
			Sorry, sample orders must be placed online.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">Can I place more than one order for samples?</span><br />
			Yes, knock yourself out!
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">How do I get sample coupons?</span><br />
			You will be emailed a sample coupon for $1.00-$5.00, based on the number of samples purchased from your sample order.  You may purchase as many samples as you want, but the maximum sample coupon credit you can earn is $5.00 per order.  For example, if your order $10.00 worth of samples you will still only earn a $5.00 sample coupon.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">How do I use my sample coupon</span><br />
			Sample coupons can be used on your next order of $20.00 or more by providing the sample coupon code, you received via email, at the checkout.  Only one coupon code can per used per order.  Sample coupons expire 90 days after the original sample order was placed.

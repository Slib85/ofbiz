Use the window that comes up to navigate to the file you want to place, select it, then click Open (Note: make sure the Replace Selected Item check box is NOT checked). A small icon with an arrowhead and paintbrush appears. Move this icon to the top left of the position you want to place the image or graphic in your document or on the pasteboard and left click.  The image or graphic appears. Now fine tune the placement of the object either through the Transform tools or by using the click-and-drag method.</p>
			<h4 class="ftc-blue marginTop10">Spot Colors</h4>
			<p class="marginTop5">When working with spot or PMS colors, make sure you select only PANTONE® Solid Coated (for coated papers) or PANTONE® Solid Uncoated (for uncoated papers) colors.  Do not choose Matte, Solid-to-Process, Hexachrome, EURO or any other type of PANTONE® color.  Do not choose HSB, LAB, RGB, TOYO, TRUMATCH or web-safe colors.  Do not mix different types of color within a document.  For instance, do not set artwork as PMS 185 C in one piece of art, PMS 185 U, in another and PMS 185 CVC in yet another.  When the document goes to press they will show up as three different color seperations instead of one.</p>
			<h4 class="ftc-blue marginTop10">Preflight the Artwork</h4>

Files will not print if elements are not included.</p>
